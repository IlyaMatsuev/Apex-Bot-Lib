# Demos

Here I'll show you how to create a chatbot based on the `Telegram` messenger example. However, the flow and steps are absolutely the same as for `Viber`!

## How to create a new bot

NOTE: If the bot record you just created disappeared it means that there was an error during the webhook configuration. In most cases, the root cause is the wrong authentication token being provided.

## Capture chat information

When you interact with a bot it saves the chat information as well as user details and messages (both user's and bot's)
